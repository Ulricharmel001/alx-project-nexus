## Chapter 1: Creating an Account

**Time: Monday, 10:30 AM**

Sarah opens her laptop and navigates to our e-commerce website. The homepage looks clean and inviting with beautiful product images and clear navigation options.

She clicks on the "Sign Up" button in the top right corner, which takes her to the registration page.

The registration form is refreshingly simple:
- Email Address: sarah.johnson@email.com

"I appreciate that they're not asking for my name or phone number upfront," Sarah thinks as she fills in her email and creates a strong password.

After clicking "Create Account," she receives a notification: "Please check your email to verify your account."

Sarah checks her inbox and finds the verification email. She clicks the verification link, and the system confirms: "Your account has been verified! You can now log in."

## Chapter 2: Searching for Products

**Time: Monday, 10:45 AM**

Now logged in, Sarah begins exploring the platform. The navigation menu shows categories like "Home Decor," "Furniture," "Kitchen," "Electronics," and "Lighting."

She's looking for a new desk lamp for her home office, so she clicks on "Home Decor" and then "Lighting." The category page loads with dozens of lamps, organized in a clean grid layout with attractive photos.

Sarah notices the search bar at the top and decides to be more specific. She types "modern desk lamp" into the search box. Within seconds, the page updates to show 15 relevant products.

The search results page displays filters on the left side:
- Price Range ($0-$50, $50-$100, $100-$200, $200+)
- Brand (Philips, IKEA, Luminous, etc.)
- Color (Black, White, Silver, Gold)
- Customer Rating (4+ stars, 3+ stars)
- In Stock

Sarah uses the price filter to narrow down to lamps between $50-$150 and selects "Modern" style from the style filter. Now she sees 8 options that match her criteria perfectly.

She scrolls through the results and finds a sleek black LED desk lamp with adjustable brightness. The product photo shows it in different lighting modes, and the customer reviews average 4.7 stars.
